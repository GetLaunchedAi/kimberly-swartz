      <p class="cs-text">
        My interest is in beauty and connection. I see it everywhere and I look for it in everyone. I document it in photography and paint. I write about it, I create it when I see an opening. I see beauty in the lines on someone's face and the depth of their stories. Not all stories are beautiful, but the strength to tell them is amazing.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        I am a life-long multi-disciplinary artist. I work in whatever medium is turning me on at the moment. I am a tribal elder with the Turtle Lake St. Croix Chippewa tribe in Wisconsin. Not having been raised in the culture, I am excited to be learning about it. I am traveling full time now and am sharing my travels here. Come along for the ride! Who knows what we will encounter next?
