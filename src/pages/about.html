      <p class="cs-text">
        Moving easily between disciplines such as painting, sculpture, singing, directing, photography, writing, and improv comedy, Kim is a creative polymath. Each medium is a new outlet for expression. Whether shaping clay, composing a scene on stage, or repairing broken bits of history, her work is driven by joy, curiosity and pursuit of beauty.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Kim’s artistic approach balances structure and spontaneity. Her background in theatre arts, photography and film has sharpened her understanding of movement, composition, and narrative, while her experience in restoration and fine art has honed her craftsmanship. A seeker of knowledge, she thrives on pushing boundaries and exploration.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Kim is a tribal elder in the Turtle Lake, St. Croix Chippewa tribe in Wisconsin.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        “I was not raised in the culture, I am excited to be learning about it, exploring connections with my Anishinaabe ancestors. I am deeply connected to the natural world, I pour that into my paintings. I am traveling full time, finding inspiration and sharing it here.”
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Kim’s work is about connection. With a brush, camera, or a comedic moment, she seeks to spark curiosity and emotion in those who engage with her art. Artistic expression is an opportunity to explore, create, and inspire.
